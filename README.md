# LinkedList

This are the starter files for Module 2 of LBYCPA2.

The src files are as follows:

## LinkedListSample.java
- Contains a sample code for Linked List.

## MyLinkedList.java
- This will be where you will implement your own Linked List ADT

## LinkedListInterface.java
- This contains the ADT functions that the data structure requires.

## ListEmptyException.java
- Exception class that will catch an error when the error ListEmptyException is called.

## MyLinkedListTest.java
- This is a JUnit testing class that checks tests for the ADT functions. The goal is to have correct testing methods for all the functions, and that the test run would be correct.
